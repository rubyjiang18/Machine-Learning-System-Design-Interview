## A/B test review

1. Central Limit Theorem

The sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distrbution as the sample size gets larger (but not infinite) no matter what the shape of the population distribution is.

X1, X2, ..., Xn are independent, identically distributed (IID), random variables, Xi has finite mean and variance

```math
\bar(X)_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i ~ N(\mu, \sigma^2)
```
